# Sleipnir

Sleipnir is a **multi-agent, multi-model collaborative LLM framework** designed to solve complex tasks through **role-based cooperation, debate, critique, and result fusion**.

Instead of relying on a single monolithic model, Sleipnir organizes multiple agents (e.g., Planner, Researcher, Coder, Critic, Judge) and optionally multiple heterogeneous LLMs to collaboratively reason, verify, and refine solutions.

>  Goal: Improve robustness, reasoning quality, and controllability of LLM systems by structured multi-agent collaboration.

##  Features

-  **Multi-Agent Architecture**
  - Planner / Worker / Critic / Reviewer / Judge (extensible)
-  **Multi-Model Support**
  - Can orchestrate different LLMs or different roles of the same LLM
-  **Collaboration Strategies**
  - Debate, Voting, Critic-Review, Self-Refine
-  **Tool-Calling Ready**
  - Web, code execution, retrieval, external systems (pluggable)
-  **Traceable Reasoning**
  - Full process logging and trajectory replay

---

##  Conceptual Workflow

1. **Task → Planner**: Decompose the task into sub-goals
2. **Multiple Agents Execute**: Each role/model generates candidate solutions
3. **Critic / Reviewer**: Find flaws, check consistency, request revisions
4. **Judge / Selector**: Rank, vote, or fuse results
5. **Final Answer + Trace**: Output with full reasoning trace

##  Design Philosophy

Sleipnir is built around the idea that:

> **Complex reasoning should not rely on a single stochastic forward pass.**

Instead, we use:

* Role diversity
* Perspective diversity
* Criticism and self-correction
* Structured consensus

to achieve **more stable and controllable intelligence**.

---

##  Typical Use Cases

* Complex reasoning & planning
* Code generation + review + repair
* Research & report generation
* Multi-step decision making
* Agent-based simulation systems
* Financial / security / system analysis (research only)

---

##  Contributing

Contributions are welcome for:

* New agents
* New collaboration strategies
* New LLM adapters
* Tool integration
* Evaluation & benchmarks

Please open an Issue or Pull Request.
